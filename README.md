Detecting Traffic Information From Social Media Texts With Deep Learning Approaches

Abstract
Social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr etc is tremendously the go-to platform for emerging internet and mobile users to share user generated comments or experiences about a variety of traffic information and other forms of public expressions on traffic. In this domain, Deep Learning Techniques will be used for public sentiment analysis on traffic information through social media.
In the existing system, the traffic information can be determined using Google Map or in FM Radio. Google Map will not give you the accurate Traffic Information. In Addition, it will not provide any information about the traffic events. FM Radio will not give you the information 24
*	7, In addition, it will provide the information only within the city or their coverage. The proposed system attempts to answer the below questions:
 How can crucial incidents be identified in social media network?
 What is the highly efficient technique to process social media texts?
 How can identified incidents be accurately categorized?
 What is the highly efficient approach to assemble data describing to the same incident?
 Classification of social media text as radical or non-radical links based on deep learning sentiment analysis approach.
 To examine the traditional feature sets like n-grams, bag-of-words, TF-IDF, bag-of- words (BoW).

Proposed system
Text-based traffic extracting, and analyzing is one of the tricky responsibilities in smart systems due to the multi-modalities of data.
There is an imperative requirement for fine-grained traffic extracting and analyzing framework. The task of extracting and analyzing framework is tricky due to different kinds of cross-domain data should be aggregated properly. Furthermore, not all types of data are obtainable all the time and more human factors are involved in this problem
 

The proposed application will be used for extracting and analysing the real-time traffic information from the social media sensor. The social media text messages can be used to analysing the traffic events with respect to
   Where the traffic event happened?
 When the traffic event happened?
 Why the traffic event happened?

The proposed system provides a unified end-to-end timeline visualization dashboard which empowers the authorities to clearer recognize of traffic incidents from social media sensor.
In this intended application, the risk factors classification and influence assessment are the main goal for the traffic safety management.
It is a gold dig for the individuals who welcome the benefit of understanding public sentiment.

In spite of the fact that there are numerous approaches to classify applications traffic, deep learning based methodologies are ending up progressively effective in these days. This is on the grounds that machine learning strategies are more proper than existing strategies for precise what's more, proficient applications traffic arrangement. Deep learning strategy can be arrangement of this problem. The best favorable position of machine learning can adapt to various circumstance regardless of whether another circumstance happens unexpectedly.
The proposed procedure includes numerous collaborative steps, such as data pre-processing, feature extraction using business experience, feature selection using weight of evidence and information value, classification, as well as model validation and result interpretation.
 



Proposed algorithm-

Deep Belief Network (DBN)



Advantages of proposed algorithm
We proposed this algorithm because of its competency in modeling and regulating dynamic systems.
